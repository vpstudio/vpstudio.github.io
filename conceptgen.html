					Several methods were used to generate concepts that would fulfill the customer specifications. First, the customer specifications were divided into separate parts in order to expand the solution space for the overall product. Second, time was spent gathering information online regarding competitor solutions as well as other related products. Lastly, idea sessions were held to bring together all the found information into potential product ideas.

					The customer specifications were divided into two parts: the physical system which is required to be portable, attractive and affordable, and the feedback system which is required to not only give a realistic drum playing experience but also provide the user with physical and visual feedback to enhance that experience. Through gathering information online and our own idea generation, solutions for both of these divisions were found. The physical system could be created using physical acceleration sensors and mechanical hardware to detect position, or could be minimized to a motion tracking unit and the user's hands. The mechanics of the feedback system have many more solution to explore, including motors for tactile feedback and a virtual display of the user's customized drum kit. Using all of the collected information and ideas, five major concepts were generated and listed below.				
				</div>
				<ol>
					<li> 
						<em>Just Hands</em> - Sit down in front of a webcam and start drumming! Nothing else required.
					</li>
					<li> 
						<em>Speed Sticks</em> - Create a mechanical system that not only lets you drum in the air, but feels like you're still banging on a real drum kit.
					</li>
					<li> 
						<em>Drumkit on the Go</em> - All you have are two pencils you picked up off the floor? No problem! Customize your drum kit in software so you can walk around campus with whatever setup you wish strapped to your chest.
					</li>
					<li> 
						<em>Oculus Rift</em> - Put on your VR headset and get teleported to center stage, rocking out in front of thousands.
					</li>
					<li> 
						<em>Drum Hero</em> - Sit down at your computer with two drumsticks and get ready to practice. Play the drum charts to your favorite tunes and get penalized when you miss a beat.
					</li>
