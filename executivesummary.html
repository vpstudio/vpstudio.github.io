				Executive Summary
			</div>
			<div id = "exec-summary">
				<div id = "text">
					Instruments such as the violin or guitar give musicians the flexibility to play almost anywhere, but drum sets don't provide the same luxury - they have large, fragile parts that are not meant to be portable. Additionally, many people simply do not have the space necessary to house a drum set, or they are afraid of disturbing their neighbors. Our solution to mobilize drummers and increase the accessibility of the instrument is to create an <em> air drum set</em>, also known as the <em>Virtual Percussive Studio (VPS)</em>, a device that mimics the sound and technique of drums without the need for bulky instruments.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					Our product will consist of three distinct systems: (1) drumsticks and foot pedals with attached sensors, (2) a motion tracking unit, and (3) a computer display. By tracking the location of the drumsticks, the system will play different sounds (eg: a hi-hat vs a snare) based on the location of the movement. All sounds will be produced through the use of the MIDI technical standard. In addition, accelerometer data from the stick tips and the motion tracking unit will allow the system to determine volume. 
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					The target audience for the VPS is the typical young adult, with little to no musical experience. This audience will require that the VPS produces the correct sound when the corresponding space is tapped, but will also benefit from a tutorial or training mode. This mode will prompt the user through pre-programmed exercises designed to introduce common drumming techniques. Additionally, the appearance and cost of the device is of high importance. The VPS will require the use of a laptop computer, so any additional materials must be lightweight and budget friendly.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					Once the VPS can produce the correct sound and volume, we can add various features to enhance user experience. LEDs on the tips of the drum sticks can be used to provide visual feedback, and small motors can be used to provide haptic feedback. We can also incorporate different MIDI libraries for various instruments to expand the versatility of the system. As a final step, we hope to bring the VPS to the realm of virtual reality in order to provide a fun and realistic experience to the user.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					Our end goal is to create a viable, robust product that is functional and cost effective. We will utilize the Leap Motion sensor as the motion tracking unit in conjunction with the MIDI standard to produce a portable drum system. The VPS will create an engaging environment through training modes and both haptic and visual feedback. If accomplished, the virtual reality component of the VPS will allow users to experience the thrill of performing as never before.
