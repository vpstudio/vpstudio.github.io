					Controller and Position Sensor Frequency
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					The world's fastest drummer can make 20 hits per second (a frequency of 20 Hz) [1]. If our position sensor can sample at more than twice the frequency of this motion, by Nyquist sampling theorem, we should be to track the position changes well enough--especially when we are only interested a general region the drum stick tip would fall in rather than an accurate physical position. The leap motion sensor has a maximum sampling rate (frame rate) of 115 Hz according to our preliminary testing, which meets our requirement. That will also be the controller frequency because the frame rate of the leap motion sensor dictates how fast we can update the software interface.

				<div id = "sub-title">
					Accelerometer Frequency
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					Adding on top of the previous section, we would like to be able to sample the accelerometer to at a frequency higher than 40 Hz and hopefully around 200 Hz. We can sample the accelerometer at a faster rate in order to decrease the latency and use the most recent position information to classify the drum sound.

					Pager Motor/Accelerometer Selection
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					The page motor would be added to the back of the gloves, but originally it was selected for adding onto the stick. The heaviest standard drumstick (size 5A) weighs 3.2 ounces, so we did want to minimize the weight of the pager motor and other components in order to keep the stick below 3.2 ounces. 
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					The Pager motor we decided upon is a 6.35 mm diameter pager motor because it could snugly
					fit onto either the stick or the glove for haptic feedback. All the characteristics,
					included in Figure \ref{fig:PagerDatasheet}, are within reason to implement.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					Although the accelerometer is not fully necessary for the implementation of an air drum set, it will allow us to (1) decrease the latency between the physical motion and the sound output and (2) increase resolution of acceleration data for better amplitude differentiation. 
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					In selecting the type of accelerometer, we must take a variety of characteristics into account. First of all, the device must be small because we are attaching it to a pair of gloves. The size is important because we want to maintain a sleek form factor that is not going to distract from the general use of the device. One of the fundamental classifications for accelerometers is how many directions of measurements the chip takes (axes). For our case, the minimum we should have is a 2-axis accelerometer. This is because we are only really interested in the planar acceleration perpendicular to the drumstick. Despite this, there is a lot more availability of 3-axis accelerometers. Furthermore, in order to decrease latency, we looked for accelerometers with an Serial Peripheral Interface protocol setup, which provides the fastest sampling frequency among other common protocols such as I2C and UART. The last quality necessary in the accelerometer is the acceleration range. Reference [9] found that the range of accelerations we should expect is from 0-7 g's (relative to Earth’s standard gravity). Although this article contains data from trials, we are unsure as to the accuracy of the data or how they triggered the drum; therefore, we will be conducting our own testing to determine ideal ranges for accelerations and tailor the accelerometer to these conditions.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					We ultimately decided upon using the ADXL345 for several reasons. First of all, it satisfies all the conditions delineated in the previous paragraph. It seems to be a general purpose 3-axis SPI accelerometer with the added advantage that there are pre-written Arduino codes to process the information. Additionally, it has an adjustable range so if we determine that the $\pm$ 8g range is not enough, we can increase it to $\pm$ 16g.

				<div id = "sub-title"> 
					Potentiometer Selection
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					There were two important factors considered when choosing which linear potentiometer to use for the kick drum/hi-hat pedals: (1) power consumption and (2) overall size. Power consumed by a passive device is $P = IV$, where $I$ is the current passing through the device and $V$ is the potential placed across the device. Assuming Ohmic behavior ($V = IR$ where $R$ is the resistance of the device), this can be rewritten as $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$. With a resistance of on the order of k$\Omega$, we will be able to place a voltage on the order of Volts across the device and burn only a few mW of power. 
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					The second reason for choosing this particular potentiometer is the overall length of the device. 30 mm gives enough movement to distinguish position accurately while still fitting within the existing geometry of the $\text{Guitar Hero}^\text{TM}$ kick pedal.
