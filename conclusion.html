					We have delivered a virtual drum set which not only makes the proper sound when the user makes a hit in the air, but also gives user a realistic drumming experience. At the expo, we demonstrated the viability of the product and the ease of use. Everybody who tried the prototype was easily able to learn how to use the setup with minimal instruction. For example, a four year old was able to pic up the sticks and play the drums within a few seconds. In addition, other than some functionality issues with the kick pedal, the product was robust and didn't fail during the entire trial period. At most, we had to recalibrate the sticks by temporarily removing them from the sensor's range. Regarding how to turn this into a commercial product, our answer is: the software is ready for commercial use, and we just need to polish and enclose our mechanical parts to make them sales-ready. In some sense, we have made a product already.

 					The end goal of the VPS is to create a more accessible, portable drum kit than the traditional drum set. Users are given an physically interactive experience, far more immersive than today's phone and tablet apps. We hope to see more inspired drummers in the near future!
