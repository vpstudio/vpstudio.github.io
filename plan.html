					The attached Gantt Chart (see Appendix) gives our expected timeline for the remainder of the semester. We have divided the the semester into four stages. After phase two, we have modified the Gantt chart a bit after rethinking about the priorities and reflecting on the current progress.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					In the first stage, all members will branch out and partition the project. Ana and Kevin are seeking auxiliary chips and sensors to add onto the main sensor. Meanwhile, Alex is interacting and experimenting with the Leap Motion sensor, which is the main motion tracking unit of our project. George is exploring the software and mechanical parts to improve user experience. 
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					In the second stage, we will bring together everything each member has amassed in the first stage and finish a basic form of our project. By the end of this stage, we aim to have a working prototype that can produce sound based on stick movement. We expect that the software will be buggy and we may have some rough edges.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					Then in the third stage, we will refine and polish our project. Software bugs will be ironed out, and the overall experience of the VPS will be improved. Our goal for stage three is ensuring that the user interface (UI) is attractive, easy to use, and interactive for the user. At the end of this stage, we have to be ready for the expo.
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					After the demo, which will be the fourth stage, we will worry about the report and the website after expo.

					After Design Review One, we decided to make the following changes to the schedule: (1) Allow a bit more time for sensor acquiry--as of now, the accelerometers are on the way; (2) Extend the working period of modification to the sticks to address the suggestions related to haptic feedback and using more electrical and mechanical components; (3) Lower the priority of the “custom arrangement of drums” feature and put that to phase three; (4) Allow more time for the remaining software artwork because we have already obtained enough to complete the basic form of our project.
