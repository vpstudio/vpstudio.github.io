							Hello! I am a 4th year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering. My primary academic focus is theoretical and applied mechanics with an emphasis on biological materials and materials with large, controllable strains. I hope to develop both theoretical models and new materials that can replicate biological functions in order to create a new form of complex, flexible robotics. Beginning in Fall 2016, I will be starting my Ph. D in Theoretical Mechanics at Caltech. In the future, I would like to become a professor because I love learning and teaching. The research based field that I am in will allow me to make developments in an academic environment while still teaching students about advanced methods and practices.

							Welcome to our small corner of the internet. I am a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering very much looking forward to graduation this spring! Building theoretical models for systems and realizing their implementations is a real passion of mine, though my true loves are the jazz saxophone and eating tremendous amounts of food. When not in lab, most of my time at Berkeley has been spent volunteering for Pioneers in Engineering, a student-run robotics outreach group on campus <a href = "https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"> (check it out!)</a>. After graduation I will be working full-time at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a System Engineer down in Pasadena, CA.

							<a href = "assets/cvs/AnastasiaShuler_April2016.pdf" target="_blank"> <img src="assets/img/ana-about.jpg" class = "about-pic cv"> <a>
								Anastasia Shuler is a graduating senior in UC Berkeley's Mechanical Engineering Department. Her main fields of interests include MEMS (MicroElectro Mechanical Systems), Fluid Dynamics, and Combustion Theory. When not focusing on academic work, Ana works serves as the current president of Pi Tau Sigma (the Mechanical Engineering Honor Society on campus) and hosts review sessions and tutoring hours for the ME community. She is also the current president of the Computer Science Undergraduate Association on campus, which helps undergrads with an interest in computer science connect with one another and puts on social events and workshops. 

								For the summer of 2016, Anastasia will be journeying to Everett, Washington to work as an Engineering Intern with the Boeing Company. She will be working on the propulsion systems for the new 737MAX. She will be returning to UC Berkeley in Fall 2016 to complete her Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

								Greetings! This is Huajian George Huang and welcome to our VPS site. My academic and research focus is medical related control and robotics, but for my class projects, I try to make them interactive and fun <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qAivLreTh8Lvb-CIUEmaA" target="_blank"> (check out my Youtube channel!)</a>.VPS is a perfect example of projects I enjoy working on. After this semester, I will continue to do research in the medical device field in graduate school.
