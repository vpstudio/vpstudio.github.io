							Hello! I am a 4th year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering. My primary academic focus is theoretical and applied mechanics with an emphasis on biological materials and materials with large, controllable strains. I hope to develop both theoretical models and new materials that can replicate biological functions in order to create a new form of complex, flexible robotics. Beginning in Fall 2016, I will be starting my Ph. D in Theoretical Mechanics at Caltech. In the future, I would like to become a professor because I love learning and teaching. The research based field that I am in will allow me to make developments in an academic environment while still teaching students about advanced methods and practices.

							Welcome to our small corner of the internet. I am a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering very much looking forward to graduation this spring! Building theoretical models for systems and realizing their implementations is a real passion of mine, though my true loves are the jazz saxophone and eating tremendous amounts of food. When not in lab, most of my time at Berkeley has been spent volunteering for Pioneers in Engineering, a student-run robotics outreach group on campus <a href = "https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"> (check it out!)</a>. After graduation I will be working full-time at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a System Engineer down in Pasadena, CA.
