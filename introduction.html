					Virtual Percussive Studio (VPS) aims to address one of the most prevalent problems with playing the drums: mobility. Currently, there is a trend to create mobile versions of various forms of technology: desktops gave way to laptops, telephones gave way to cellphones, and many more. In music, synthesizers and the MIDI technical standard have allowed musicians to access the sounds of various instruments anywhere they have access to a computer. While this may be ideal for keyboard players, drums have a spatial attribute that is not represented by a keyboard or synth-pad layout.

					This air drum set will ameliorate some of these concerns by (1) providing a mobile alternative to a physical drum set, and (2) reintroduce the spatial aspect of drums to a synthesizer. The VPS will utilize a Leap Motion sensor and a variety of embedded sensors to create a virtual drum set that the user can easily play using specially designed drum sticks. No physical surfaces (drum pads) are necessary for the device to function properly - users only need the drumsticks, Leap Motion sensor, and a laptop computer. This makes the VPS a mobile drum kit that allows the users to play anytime and anywhere, without disturbing neighbors. 
				</div>
				<div id = "text">
					The VPS will provide an interactive environment through tutorial and training modes. Users can challenge their friends to see who is the best drummer of them all, and those new to the world of music can work on their rhythm and timing with pre-programmed exercises. This training, combined with the mobility of the VPS, gives rising musicians the ability to hone their skills wherever they chose.
